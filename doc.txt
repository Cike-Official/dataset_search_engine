Proposed Title:
"Semantic Search Engine for Machine Learning Datasets Using NLP"

Title Description:
This project aims to develop a semantic search engine that enables natural language-based dataset retrieval using NLP techniques. It will help users find machine learning datasets by understanding the context and meaning of their queries rather than relying on exact keyword matches.

Questions Addressed:
1. What are the information needs your search engine supports?

Users need relevant machine learning datasets based on contextual search queries rather than simple keyword-based retrieval.
Supports query understanding (e.g., "datasets for fraud detection" should return financial fraud datasets, even if "fraud detection" isnâ€™t explicitly mentioned in the dataset title).
Allows filtering and ranking of datasets based on metadata, descriptions, and relevance scores.

2. What is the targeted domain?

The primary domain is machine learning and data science.
The search engine is designed for data scientists, AI researchers, and engineers who need to find high-quality datasets efficiently.
Sources could include Kaggle, Data.gov, OpenML, UCI ML Repository, and other public dataset platforms.

3. How do you want to provide a search service?

NLP-powered query understanding using transformer models (BERT, SBERT, or a lightweight alternative) for semantic similarity matching.
Indexing datasets using Elasticsearch or FAISS for efficient search and retrieval.
A web-based search interface where users can enter natural language queries, apply filters, and browse ranked results.
Potential integration with metadata extraction (e.g., dataset format, size, domain, and keywords).
