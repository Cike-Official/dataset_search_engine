To capture the complex structure of fashion objects and ambiguity in descriptions obtained from crawling the web, our standardized taxonomy contains 46 apparel objects (27 main apparel items and 19 apparel parts), and 92 related fine-grained attributes. Secondly, a total of around 50K clothing images (10K with both segmentation and fine-grained attributes, 40K with apparel instance segmentation) in daily-life, celebrity events, and online shopping are labeled by both domain experts and crowd workers for fine-grained segmentation.",
